# RSA Cryptosystem in Python

The RSA Cryptosystem is a widely used public-key cryptographic system that relies on the mathematical challenge of factoring large prime numbers. It is commonly used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange in various communication systems.

It was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, from whose initials it gets its name. RSA uses a pair of keys: a public key for encrypting messages and a private key for decrypting them. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. 

This project has an example of a Python RSA implementation in a demonstrative way.

## Warning
This code must not be implemented as a real cryptosystem in real world. Only should be used with explanatory purposes. 

## About Code

The program was coded in Python, and with the minimum amount of libraries. Comments are in spanish, since this code were used with pedagogical purposes on a Number Theory class in Mexico.

## Usage

There is neccesary to have the two files (user 1 and user 2 conversation) with the text you want to send in a directory called 'textos', before you run the code.
